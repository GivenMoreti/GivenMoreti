Hi I am a fullstack developer currently studying computer science and Information technology.
My modules for 2023 includes Python, C# Windows Desktop Applications and C++ fundamentals.
I am looking to collaborate on big projects built in stacks such as MERN,Python Django or React Native.
Highly backend based although React Native really thrills me on a mobile dev end.
My email is moretigven@gmail.com, get in touch and let's cook a killer technological collosal.
Happy coding!
